The command line is a tool which allows a user to navigate through their computer's files and give it instructions, for example, creating a file, or running a program. The command line used to be the common way to use a computer. Nowadays most people use what is called a graphical interface to interact with their computer. On a Mac the graphical interface is Finder. Graphical interfaces allow us to perform the same tasks that we can perform on the command line, with the use of visual tools such as icons and windows rather than text-based 'commands'. This is better suited to the everyday computer user. The command line is useful for programmers as it allows for quicker and more direct access to the 'behind the scenes' tasks that a developer might want to perform.
